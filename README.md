# Read me
Welcome to the very first 'Epic Runtime Tag Editing Tool' for Halo Infinite. 
- If you want to read some useful documentations and check out some guides you can do this here (when its ready and finalized): https://www.halocustoms.com/modding-wiki/haloinfinite/


**Currently**
- We now support all tags (Well. Kinda.) 
- If they don't load then there's an issue with the value mappings). Please shoot me a message on where ever and I'll look into it.

**Thanks To the following people**
- Lord Zedd and Exhibit for their amazing work on dumping the tag definitions, which was a massive help to understand how the tag definitions work.

- Enormous thanks to Krevil for his tool (https://github.com/Krevil/InfiniteModuleReader) that allows us to dump the Tag Names & IDs, in this way, we can see the correct names of each tag and easily re-dump the info at anytime when there's a change in the module information.

- A Pretty huge thanks to Callum Carmicheal for the various contributions and the UI (which now doesn't look terrible lol) - Nice work! 

- The Halo Mods Crew for being awesome!

- Thanks to Gamecheat13 for being able to help get the tool work again after updates!

- A Big thank you goes out to TypeChecked for the awesome icon!

- Late shoutout to my uncle for the birthday money that allowed me to get the campaign, pretty much funding this entire project lol

- Shoutouts to Sopitive for his generous PR requests, and continuing to add Quality of life improvements when I haven't gotten around to doing so.

- Thanks to TempAccountNull for his constant help with updating the tool, while I haven't been working on the project. He'll take over from now on.
